# Introduction

Hello! Originally, we had no plans of making this textbook open-source, but
with many requests to do so and some really great ideas for additions, we sort
of started thinking that this was a no-brainer!

**Please read these guidelines thoroughly!** There is definitely a lot of good
advice in here, and there even may be some things you find surprising.

For instance, writing a chapter on breaking neural-network based security 
measures may be a wonderful piece of writing, but may not find a logical place
in this Primer for many months or years. We are open to ideas outside the scope
of the issues on this repo, but in those cases, please discuss with us before
submitting a PR with a 20 page chapter!

In general, providing code examples in other programming languages that we have
not included is very useful and a great way to start contributing. We won't be
listing issues for that.

Claiming issues (or asking to claim issues) is also a great way to contribute,
but these may tend to be fairly involved.

We are not interested in any PR's that address writing style. We will consider
those that address punctuation, spelling and grammar.


# Ground Rules

* At a minimum, expect the review of your PR to take 2 weeks.
* At a minimum, ensure that asciidoctor renders your text source without errors
* Keep as much discussion as possible on our public Discord server so that
  others can benefit from your previous experience.


# Submitting Changes and Additions

For all changes and additions that you would like credit for, please follow
these steps:

1. Create your own fork of this repo on GitHub
2. Make the changes in your fork
3. If you like the results and think others could benefit from your work as 
   well, send a pull request (PR) with your desired changes.

If you have a small change (such as punctuation, spelling, etc.) and do not
mind being anonymous, you can ping us on Discord and we will commit on your 
behalf.


# Proposing Something New

We will try to maintain a good list of issues in which we would greatly 
appreciate help in addressing, however, as history has shown, we're not the 
only ones with good ideas. However, we do have an idea of what the Primer will
be (even if that is still forming), and we would like to connect early with 
contributors with new or big ideas. Reach out to us on Discord, but submitting
an issue on GitHub with your idea would probably be fine too.
