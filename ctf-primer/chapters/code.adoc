// LT: So my bit here I took out of my reversing chapter and stuck it here
// because it seems like it would be more cohesive to be in a chapter dedicated
// to coding (perhaps more abstractly than code considered in your web
// chapter). I'd like to point my reversing chapter to this bit on "Levels of
// Code" but not have it inline with the more reversing-centric material

//  Levels of Code outline (originally in reversing outline)
//    High-level Languages
//    Low-level Languages
//    Intermediate Representation (IR)
//    Assembly & ISAâ€™s
//    Machine Instructions
