== Reverse Engineering

Reversing finds the most important parts of software quickly and understands
them deeply. Though it is a specific and rare set of skills, there are a myriad
of ways to use the knowledge it yields. One may exploit software or fix it,
create malware or exterminate it, bypass protections or enhance them. A good
reverser understands the aspects of software that the authors did not expect
anyone else to understand, and a master reverser understands things about
software that even the authors of it know nothing about.

IMPORTANT: In the context of CTF's, *reversing* typically means analyzing a
software artifact to discover its vulnerabilities, hidden information, or
dormant functionality.

The next section covers the definition and history of the discipline in much
more depth. Feel free to skip that section, and go straight to our
consideration of the most common high-level goals for reverse engineering, or
go straight to the next section to get into the details of common challenges in
reversing.

=== Linguistics, Etymology & our Predecessors

TIP: Optional section. BLUF: Reversing has existed for centuries and has always
meant deconstructing something man-made to understand it better.

I'm a bit of a history buff and I greatly enjoy the origins of words as well.
This section started with finding a good definition of "reverse engineering,"
but inevitably, it dredged up more than just that!

I may have marked this section optional, but if I did not think it was
important, I would not have written it at all. Understanding the origin of the
term and how those who have gone before us practiced the discipline is not an
exercise in optimizing proficiency in modern reversing techniques but rather an
exercise in understanding what is possible when applying an ancient discipline
to a new medium, and perhaps avoiding some pitfalls that our predecessors did
not.

.On the Reliability of Wikipedia
[NOTE]
It is important to note that while Wikipedia is not a great source for
say, a history paper, it tends to very often be an excellent source of
knowledge for sciences, esp. "arcane" ones like computer security. Of course,
even for these subjects, using the Wikipedia article's sources are even better
still!

I think Wikipedia's definition of "reverse engineering" is really good.
Dictionary definitions I've seen tend to create different definitions for
reverse engineering machines versus software. The Wikipedia article at the time
of this writing captures both well. I have paraphrased it below:

____
Reverse engineering is the process by which a man-made object, entity, or
artifact is deconstructed to reveal its designs, architecture, or to extract
knowledge.

=== Profiles of Reversers

As intimated in the introductory paragraph to reversing, in spite of how
specific reverse engineering skills are, there are many ways in which these
skills can be used and for very different goals. The next secitons cover some
of the most common profiles for reverse engineering in the world of software.
Although there are different goals for each profile, the means to them is the
same: gaing deeper understanding of software by reverse engineering.
