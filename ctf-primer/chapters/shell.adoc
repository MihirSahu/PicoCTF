== The Shell
[[shl]]
The Shell is foundational to so many parts of securing computing devices and 
their networks. Intimidating and alluring (like most symbols enshrined by film
makers), understanding the shell can make or break one's ability to solve 
challenges in a capture-the-flag competition like picoCTF.

To be transparent, I (LT) am still learning a lot about the shell, and I'm
just about 10 years into it right now! This is an encouragement - anyone 
curious enough to jump into rabbit holes here and there is always going to have
opportunities to learn more about an amazing tool like the shell. But rest 
assured, I was proficient in the shell long ago and it does not take very much
time before the shell starts working for *you*.

Next up, what is that mystique unique to the hacker and their shell?

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
=== Symbol of the Hacker
[[shl-symbol-of-the-hacker]]
//TODO punt :put animation here of terminal prompt w blinking cursor!
//TODO punt :consider using hacker typer to demonstrate "flow of info"

A blank, black screen and blinking cursor. Lines and lines of scrolling text
and someone in front of that screen who seemingly understands an
incomprehensible flow of information. That is the shell.

The shell has many other names: the terminal, the command prompt, bash...
PowerShell, if you're looking at Windows and feeling blue. Each name has its
own nuances. But that doesn't matter right now. What matters is that there is
the interface to computing devices that nearly all people use, and then there
is the shell.

If you've come here to get a shell and don't care for much else, then you
should skip to the <<shl-get-a-shell,Get a Shell>> section. Be warned that the
shell is more powerful than the usual way of interacting with a device.
Deleting files is permanent in the shell, any file can be accessed at any
moment in the shell, and hopefully it's not farfetched to assert that those
two things are a dangerous combination.

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
=== Got Shell?
[[shl-got-shell]]

Using a computer or smart device happens in 1 of 2 ways:

1. Using a pointer such as a mouse, touchpad or finger to select apps, files,
   or buttons
2. Using keys on a keyboard to enter simple or complex commands (the Shell)

Thankfully, there are TLA's (Three Letter Acronyms) for both methods
described above:

1. GUI. Pronounced "gooey," stands for Graphical User Interface
2. CLI. Sounded out: "See-El-Eye," stands for Command Line Interface

These acronyms are pretty good as far as acronyms go. We will refer to the
shell by many names, perhaps sometimes even by the CLI initialism. The GUI
doesn't have as nice of a name as the shell, so we will probably use GUI to
briefly refer to the interface that everyone knows about on computing devices
that is driven by a pointer on a screen.

Below is a screenshot of a shell after successful login and before the user has
typed in any commands:

[[first-look,First look at a new shell]]
[.text-center]
.The shell waiting for a command
image::images/shl-1-first-look-shell.png[]

In the picture above, there is a lot of empty space, and even the line of text
that exists, does not provide a lot of clarity. The situation is simpler than
how it looks. There are only 3 pieces of information in the screenshot above,
and you would likely recognize at least one of them if it were *you* who logged
on:

// TODO ssp^ punt :
// implement simple mock terminal to provide an interactive, fun quiz, that
// starts to build confidence in shell looks good: https://terminal.jcubic.pl/

In terms of raw power, Q0h313th could delete every file they own on this
machine with one command. That's almost never desirable, and I will wait to
show this command until there is something useful and desirable to do with it.
In terms of useful power, Q0h313th could create a copy of an entire website for
use when there is no accessible WiFi. That's using the command `wget`.

Now let's talk about *getting* a shell!

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
=== Get a Shell
[[shl-get-a-shell]]
Cybersecurity is a topic that is most deeply learned by listening *and* doing.
For this reason, I advise you to create a picoCTF account at this point if
you have not already. Beyond providing 120+ security challenges in helpful
learning ramps, every picoCTF account gets access to a web-based Linux _shell_.

A note on the structure of my (LT's) chapters: many times I will provide a high
level tutorial for a task and also a step by step walkthrough for the same
task.  This is my attempt at accommodating different learning styles and,
different levels of experience. Typically, the high-level walkthrough is more
for learners who already know the basics but need a refresher or need a
reminder about the particulars when it comes to this Primer. The step by step
walkthrough is more for learners who have never ventured in a particular task
before. Of course, you must choose your own path here, but the safest bet may
be to read the high-level walkthrough but actually put hands to keyboard for
the step by step walkthrough.

==== High level tutorial
. *Gain access to a practice shell*
.. Register for a picoCTF account
  * Click link in email that is sent to registered email address
... Log in to the picoCTF webshell

==== Step by Step Walkthrough
//TODO punt : turn bold text into hyperlinks in this section
*Register for a picoCTF account at the link below.* You will need to
validate the email address you provide by clicking on a link that is sent to
it.

https://play.picoctf.org/

After successfully registering, a web shell can be accessed at the URL below.
*Use the same  user name and password that you registered on the picoCTF
website to log into the shell at the link below* (or in the "Webshell" panel
on the picoCTF website) For the sake of security, you will not see your password
as you type it in.

==== Debrief
Congratulations (esp. if this is your first time staring at a command prompt)!
The next section focuses on demystifying the shell by relating its usage to
devices you've probably already used for years; and if not, you'll join the
ranks of those whose first language is Shell.


//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
=== GUI-fu to Shell-fu
[[shl-gui-fu-to-shell-fu]]
Our first language as children, whether Spanish, English or anything else
primarily for communication with other humans, likely took little conscious
effort on our part. For anyone who has learned a second language, it was quite
the opposite: very little - if anything - came naturally. Learning Shell for
someone who has only "spoken" GUI is like learning a second language. This is
good news and bad news. The good news is that Shell and GUI are languages for
something you've been using for probably years, but the bad news is there is a
whole new vocabulary with only a handful of cognates (words that sound and mean
the same in both languages) here and there.

The basic computer operations that everyone is familiar with in GUI's can
easily be done in the shell as well. Here's some of the most common operations
for anyone using a computing device: 

.Basic computer operations
|===
|Operation |GUI action |Shell action |Shell example |Note

|Start app
|Click or touch icon of app
|Type name of app and press enter
|`$ date`
|Pressing the Enter key sends the command to the shell to run and return.

|Open file
|Browse to file, click
|Use `cat` app to print file
|`$ cat ~/my-file.txt`
|`cat` displays all text in a file.

|Download app
|Browse app store, click
|Use `apt` to download app
|`$ apt install chessx`
|Install ChessX game. The hard part was finding a relevant package name.
|===

As the table above shows, using a GUI involves browsing and clicking, while
using a shell involves knowing a good app to use. Google has made finding the
right app for a shell interface much easier than it was years ago. As always
for CTF's, Google is your friend! However, more direct resources can be even
more helpful, such as this website below that quickly explains shell commands:

https://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=date

However, things do not always go as planned. The next section deals with
those sorts of situations that inevitably arise.

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
=== What the Shell!?
[[shl-what-the-shell]]
//learning curve due to memorization, lots of typing, and memorizing arguments
The main severity in the learning curve with the shell is that you must know
the apps and commands available to you either by memorization or by looking
them up when you need them. Certainly, it is faster to memorize as many as
possible.

The other challenge is the amount of typing that sometimes must be done to
reference the intended file.

Lastly, interfacing with apps also requires memorizing or looking up names of
parameters or arguments.

To summarize, some of the most challenging aspects of using the shell:

1. Memorizing commands (aka apps/programs)
2. Typing out long commands
3. Memorizing arguments for commands

==== Challenge 1: Memorizing commands
Having a cheat sheet with shell commands listed is a must for overcoming the
challenge of memorizing commands. Printing it out is a bonus if possible!
(Saves screen space). The cheat sheet linked below is very good!

https://www.git-tower.com/blog/command-line-cheat-sheet/


==== Challenge 2: Typing out long commands
Many wonderfully brilliant students of mine have not known how to speed up
their typing in the shell command prompt until thousands of picoCTF points into
their learning. I take responsibility for this, and really, most of us go
through that phase, but we do not have to! One word:

*TAB*

In the shell, pressing the TAB key invokes auto-complete by 1. assuming you've
spelled the command or file correctly up to the point of pressing tab, and 2. 
completing the command of file name as much as it can.

The functionality of auto-complete in the shell is so different from
auto-complete in other apps, such as those in a phone, that shell auto-complete
is often referred to as tab-complete. It takes some practice to get used to,
but it is worth the time as it probably cuts number of key presses in half!

Unlike auto-complete for a soft keyboard on a phone, tab-complete is never 
wrong, however, this is mostly because it makes no guesses and only helps with
completing commands and file paths and names. It hardly ever helps complete
arguments to commands besides file names. If pressing tab doesn't do anything,
this is either because 1. there is no such command or file name to complete
what you've already typed into the command prompt, or 2. there are multiple 
commands or file names that could complete what you've already typed into the
command prompt. Try typing another letter or two. Hit the tab key again. If
nothing more is completed, hit tab one more time. If nothing really happens
besides an angry noise or flash, then there is no way to complete what you've
already typed (maybe there is a typo?), but if the issue is that there are 
multiple possibilities for tab complete to choose, then these options will 
display after your second strike on the tab key. The double press of tab can
be done at any time, but if there are hundreds of options then the shell will
ask for your approval before printing all those options because that's not
usually very helpful.

In the next section, I will guide you through some fundamental shell commands
to start getting a sense for the world of the shell.

==== Shell Nav Exercise 1
//TODO :==== Common Tasks
//      such as editing a document (nano!) (for making source code)
//      creating code (simple shell script to make a task solution permanent)
```
# SOME NOTES: 
# * text listed after "$" I mean for you to enter into the shell and then
#   press enter
# * text listed after "#" are comments from me to you but are ignored by 
#   the shell
#
# this short tutorial is meant to run through foundational shell commands 
# with brief explanations for each

# the following command "parks" your shell in your home directory (which is
# somewhere you can create files!)

$ cd


# the following command shows where your shell is parked

$ pwd


# the following command creates a new directory called "tutorial" where you
# are currently parked

$ mkdir tutorial


# the following command moves your shell and parks it in the "tutorial" folder
# you just created

$ cd tutorial


# pwd stands for "print working directory". "working directory" is the 
# technical term for where one's shell is parked

$ pwd


# the following command creates an empty file with the name "note.txt"

$ touch note.txt


# the following command list the contents of your working directory

$ ls


# personally, I prefer a one column output of the contents of my working 
# directory, like

$ ls -l


# the following command shows the text content of "note.txt" (which is empty
# right now)

$ cat note.txt


# the following command puts "hello world! I'm a snail" into "note.txt"

$ echo "hello world! I'm a snail" > note.txt


# cat will print something now that there is content in "note.txt"

$ cat note.txt


# the following command makes a copy of "note.txt" called "new-note.txt"

$ cp note.txt new-note.txt


# what is in "new-note.txt"?

$ cat new-note.txt


# * the following command opens "new-note.txt" in a terminal text editor
# * try changing the file, then press Ctrl-X to exit and save

$ nano new-note.txt


# if you were successful, this command should print the new content

$ cat new-note.txt


# if you were not successful, that is just fine. revisit this exercise after
# some more reading and practice!

```

=== Conclusion
You may have noticed that we did not cover overcoming challenge 3. If you are
curious, look up the `man` command explained in this cheat sheet:

https://www.git-tower.com/blog/command-line-cheat-sheet/

Using Google helps with learning commands to help solve problems in the shell,
and also the "Explain Shell" website I linked to earlier in this chapter.

There is so much to learn in the shell, but before learning more, my friend
will continue as your guide in the next chapter on the Python programming
language. Using the `nano` text editor app, as described in the tutorial
above, you now have the skills to write programs in the shell!

Let the Shell lessons sink in as you learn more about one of the most popular
and powerful programming languages to grace the Earth.
