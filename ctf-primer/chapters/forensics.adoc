== Forensics

=== What is Forensics?

In general, computer science professionals refer to "Digital Forensics" as "Forensics", for simplicity's sake. Digital Forensics is the field in cybersecurity that tries to gather and understand evidence after an incident, which can be crime, to determine how it happened. This not only helps law enforcement when pledging someone innocent or guilty, but also to understand how to improve security in a system that was successfully attacked. Digital Forensics focuses on gathering evidence present in computer devices that hold information electronically. It is a branch of Forensic Science, which can also investigate any type of crime even if there is not computer media involved. 

=== How to search for strings and filenames

We will begin by learning how to search for information in a file system.  Go to the picoCTF webshell at:
https://webshell.picoctf.org/

Once you are connected, download the file ‘files.zip’ from the following url:
https://primer.picoctf.org/files/files.zip

To do that, run:

[source, txt]
wget https://primer.picoctf.org/files/files.zip

That will download the .zip file, which is a compressed folder, to your current folder. 
To uncompress it, run:

[source, txt]
unzip files.zip

You will obtain a folder called ‘files’ in your current directory. Let’s try a little challenge. That folder has a  lot of files and folders. More than 8000 files. Try to find the following string there:

[source, txt]
information on the record will last a billion years. Genes and brains and books

You know by now that you can access folders using the command ‘cd’. For example, to access the folder ‘files’ that you just uncompressed, you can run:

[source, txt]
cd files

But in more than 8000 files, it is very hard to find one string to exploring the files manually. We have computers to help us with that. 
You could run:

[source, txt]
grep -r "information on the record will last a billion years. Genes and brains and books"

Note that grep is a program in Linux intended for searching strings in files. The ‘-r’ in the command, is used to tell grep that It should search any folder inside the current folder. When you run it, you will see something like this:
grep -r "information on the record will last a billion years. Genes and brains and books"
folder_pmbymkjcya/folder_cawigcwvgv/folder_ltdayfmktr/folder_fnpfclfyee/whzxrpivpqld.txt:information on the record will last a billion years. Genes and brains and books encode
Note that the string you wanted was found. It shows you the path of the file. In this case, is:

[source, txt]
folder_pmbymkjcya/folder_cawigcwvgv/folder_ltdayfmktr/folder_fnpfclfyee/whzxrpivpqld.txt

We can see that even if we have a huge amount of files, a computer can find something very quickly. Now, suppose we know the name of the file, and we want to know the path. Suppose you want to find the file called ‘file_klcvdqhi.txt’
You can run:
find . -name file_klcvdqhi.txt


As an output, you should see the path:

[source, txt]
./folder_aziwuihrzs/folder_noitiuqyjv/file_klcvdqhi.txt

To practice, find the path of the following files:

[source, txt]
file_ebmjfalaycoai.txt
file_swdbhgvbkkythij.txt
file_sivftkrsckd.txt

What is the content on each of them?

Now, identify the file name in which is contained each of the following 3 pieces of text:

[source, txt]
collapse and star formation. In this sense, stars have parents; and, as is sometimes also true

[source, txt]
such as meters or miles, chosen for their utility on Earth, would make little sense. Instead,

[source, txt]
ancient kings and heroes deified by later generations.

That was rather simple. However, it is an important ability to have. Soon we wil publish content about forensics in more depth. Stay tuned!
