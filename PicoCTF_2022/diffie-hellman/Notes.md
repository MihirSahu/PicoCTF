1. Read up on the [diffie-hellman key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange#Cryptographic_explanation)
2. Calculate the secret key using the `Cryptographic Explanation` section in the wikipedia article. The secret key should be 5
3. I wrote a script to decode the ceasar cipher using a list of uppercase letters and digits
4. Run the script to find `picoCTF{C4354R_C1PH3R_15_4_817_0U7D473D_5E3C2EE2}`
