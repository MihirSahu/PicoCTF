1. Find the line number of the user `cultiris`. We find that it's line 378
2. Find the password associated with it on line 378 of passwords.txt, which is `cvpbPGS{P7e1S_54I35_71Z3}`
3. Use cyberchef to try different algorithms, and we find that it's encoded with ROT13. Decode it to get `picoCTF{C7r1F_54V35_71M3}`
