# This is one of the most annoying challenges I've ever worked on.

1. Use `file` to check which compression algorithm was used to compress the file
2. If you don't have the algorithm installed, install it with package manager
3. If you get an error message like `unknown suffix -- ignored` that means that you need to change the extension of the file to make it work with the algorithm

## KEEP GOING. It might make you feel like you're going in an endless loop, but it truly is a long challenge
